# Things to know

I have added the following dependencies to this project:
- tailwind
- line-clamp tailwind plugin
- heroicons
- axios

A 'npm install' should install them.

I am using typescript. I did write a test in the App.test.tsx file but couldn't get the test to work. Needed more time on that. 

I made the table which displays in the data filterable by adding a search field above it. Also, if a row is clicked then it will drop down to show more information on the address and company.
